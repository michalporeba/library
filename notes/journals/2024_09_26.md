- LATER [Znaleźć i zniszczyć](https://www.empik.com/znalezc-i-zniszczyc-piotr-mitkiewicz-wiktor-swietlik,p1517603580,ksiazka-p ) In a recent interview in [[Historia Realna]] the book by a Polish volunteer fighting in Ukraine has been recommended. It sounds interesting.

- Re-reading [[Programming Reactive Extensions and LINQ]] to decide whether to keep it or remove it. The technology is clearly aged. The content of the book appeared much more novel when I read it first around 2012. Now, the book provides an interesting historical perspective on what was happening in C# coding around 2010, it is very unlikely I will want to read it again.
