- Started reading [[The Burnout Society]]
	- Obviously a philosophical essay, not an easy read.
	- In the first chapter the author contrasts mental health problems with health problems of the past, bacterial, viral. It is not like it, it is much more like obesity, cause by too much of a good thing and so the immune system is not triggered. Is the customer centric process of everything, of the society contributing to the problem?
