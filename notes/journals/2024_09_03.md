- Listening to [[Medic]]
	- Chapter 3
		- British evacuation from Dunkirk. The British Army provisions for medical care have significantly diminished from the Great War but a lot has changed both in the medicine, and in the development of arms. Some knowledge was taken from the Spanish civil war as one of the doctors from there came to London and gave lectures.
		- It was now obvious that to save lives the medical staff will have to put their at risk, as it is important that the wounded are helped within the first 3-4 hours, much earlier than what the staged evacuation practiced previously allowed.
		- The practice is being changed rapidly. Clearly the doctors are experimenting with new treatments, new procedures, often at odds with previous knowledge, to maximise lives saved, even if this means some more severely, perhaps beyond hope, casualties are ignored.
		- The stories are not very different to stories told by in interviews by [[Damian Duda]], Polish med evac volunteer who spend many years at the front lines in Ukraine, including during the battle of Bachmut.
