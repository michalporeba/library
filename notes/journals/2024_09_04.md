- Listening to [[Medic]]
	- Chapter 4
		- The story moves to the far east. In Europe medics and doctors had a chance to be treated well as non-combatants, and even repatriated after being captured. Japanese bushido code made no such allowances. The chapter focuses on how bad conditions and the treatment was in the far east, mostly in the prisoner of war camps. Doctors were improvising with primitive tools, scraping ulcers clean of dead flesh with spoons, covering wounds with bamboo bark.
