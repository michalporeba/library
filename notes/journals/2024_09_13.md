- Listening to [[Medic]]
	- Chapter 13 - Falluja
		- The medics joined the soldiers on the front line, but often continued working beyond the fight.
		- [[Quote]]: Even when he was on the trolley and being sprinted into the A&E room they were still pumping away. It impressed all of us, Grant said. We've just crash landed! It was all the rest of us could do was to stumble out of the helicopter, but the medics just kept on going with their treatment. Hardly ever seemed to blink.
		  We just crash landed.
		- Quick Clot was introduced. Treatment was painful but was saving lives.
	- Chapter 14
		- The chapter focuses on the increasing role of women on front lines. The british army stlii doesn't allow them to take combat roles so they serve as medics. But the nature of the war has changed so, that there are no longer clear front and back lines so they find themselves in the middle in the fight anyway.
		- There are two examples. Ellie DZ was killed when her vehicle run over a mine or an IED soon after deploying for the second time as a first class medic (previously serving as second class). Her story is contrasted with [[Michelle Norris]] - first woman to be awarded the [[Military Cross]].
	- A number of stories in the book follow the medals. It reminds me of [[Victoria Cross Heroes]] book by [Lord Ashcroft]([[Michael Ashcroft]])
