- Listening to [[1984 (Book)]]
	- Recently I have heard fragments of an abridged version of 1984 on BBC 4.
	- Yesterday, monitoring of citizens came up in a discussion I had with somebody.
	- The first time I read 1984 over 20 years ago, in Polish, and the book didn't make much of an impression on me.
	- This time, listening to the original it is different. Especially the descriptions of places in London, the St Martins in the Field are very familiar. London itself is familiar.
