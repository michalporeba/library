- Listening [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]
	- Part III. O'Brian's explanation of the purpose of power. "The object of power is power". Surprisingly it reminded me of political realism, and interviews I have seen with [[John Mearsheimer]]. The super powers strive to preserve their powers to maintain their status as super powers. The [[Covert Regime Change]] shows just the extent to which they will go, to retain that power.
	- I haven't planned on switching my reading focus to social or political topics, but perhaps I should read his [[The Trategy of Great Power Politics]]?
