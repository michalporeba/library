- Listening [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]
	- Part III. O'Brian's explanation of the purpose of power. "The object of power is power". Surprisingly it reminded me of political realism, and interviews I have seen with [[John Mearsheimer]]. The super powers strive to preserve their powers to maintain their status as super powers. The [[Covert Regime Change]] shows just the extent to which they will go, to retain that power.
	- I haven't planned on switching my reading focus to social or political topics, but perhaps I should read his [[The Strategy of Great Power Politics]]?
	- I don't remember if the appendix was part of the translation I read long time ago. It is very interesting from the linguistic point of view. I wonder how much Orwell knew about Esperanto and how it works, but to me the similarities, and more importantly part of the guiding principals behind the mechanics of the language are obvious.
