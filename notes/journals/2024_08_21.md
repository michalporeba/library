- Listening to [[Covert Regime Change]]
	- Chapter on covert operations in Albania, Yugoslavia and Ukraine.
	- Very interesting details on Stefan Bandera and CIA involvement in funding his organisation and operations up until 1954.
	- The author makes claim, that it is likely that the operation Rollback started after the end of the second world war by the US contributed significantly to the start of the cold war.
	- Stefan Bandera was in Polish prison for assassination of a Polish secretary of state (or minister). He was released by occupants after the war broke out in 1939. He then was funded by Germans to support operation Barbarossa. I have known previously about Bandera's activities after 1945 not knowing they were funded by the US. However, that earlier history and involvement in the operation Barbarossa paints the current situation in Ukraine, the narratives about it, in a very different light.
