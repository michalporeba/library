- Listening to [[Medic]]
	- Chapter 18
		- Wrapping things up many stories introduced in the previous chapters are brought back in, to talk about what happened to the medics and wounded they saved once their wars have ended. In many cases they suffered mentally.
		- The chapter describes how treatment has changed over time. After the Falklands, all those involved got 6 weeks leave after returning. Now, with the hindsight, it is obvious that was a mistake. Now soldiers coming back home, are given time to cool down, but with others who had the same experiences as theirs.
		- There was a debate where should doctors be, how far from the front lines, considering the time it takes to train them. But the argument slowly got settled "in favour of the action men", those who wanted to be close to the front line to have higher impact.
		- [Tim Hodgetts]([[Timothy Hodgetts]]) was clear about the role of doctors during his time in Iraq and then Afghanistan where as a colonel he was often seen picking up privates directly from the battlefield. He was sure that the life of doctors are not more important than those of private soldiers. "He led from the front. Much to surprise of soldiers in the field who were not used to seeing a full colonel running out of a helicopter to treat them as they laid wounded and under fire".
