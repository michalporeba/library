- Listening to [[Medic]]
	- Chapter 18
		- Wrapping things up many stories introduced in the previous chapters are brought back in, to talk about what happened to the medics and wounded they saved once their wars have ended. In many cases they suffered mentally.
		- The chapter describes how treatment has changed over time. After the Falklands, all those involved got 6 weeks leave after returning. Now, with the hindsight, it is obvious that was a mistake. Now soldiers coming back home, are given time to cool down, but with others who had the same experiences as theirs.
