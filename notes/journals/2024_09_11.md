- Listening to [[Medic]]
	- Chapter 12 starts with the First Gulf War. Quickly it moves to Northern Ireland and then Kosovo.
		- There is a mention of a doctor that started emergency medicine as a discipline (in the army?) but I don't remember the name, and couldn't quickly look it up.
		- In Kosovo for the first time the military ambulances were equipped as well as those on the streets in Britain. In addition to stretchers and bandages they had things like defibrillators, monitors, suctions, splints and so on, and were crewed by paramedics not only technicians.
		- "Seniority saved lives" - junior doctors from previous wars were replaced by consultant level doctors in forward positions, in temporary operating theatres.
		- The type of casualties military doctors dealt with changed. No longer there were mostly soldiers. Instead, mostly civilians including children and elderly.
		- In 2003 Iraq again the casualties have changed again because of the asymmetric warfare. The casualties were very few in between and very often treated by full teams of surgeons including very experienced specialists working to save a few wounded. Much more like peace time medicine.
