		- [Nietzsche]([[Friedrich Nietzsche]]) in *Twilight of the Idols writes that one must learn "not to reac immediately to a stimulus, but instead to take control of the inhibiting, excluding instincts".
		- Negativity is important to slow down rather than just run endlessly like a machine.
		- [[Quote]]: There are two forms of potency. Positive potency is the power to do something. Negative potency, in contrast, is the power not to do - to adopt Nietzsche's phrasing, the power to say no. [...] If one only possessed the positive ability to perceive (something) and not the negative ability not to perceive (something), one's senses would stand utterly at the mercy of rushing, intrusive stimuli and impulses. [...] If one had only the power to do (something) and no power not to do, it would lead to fatal hyperactivity. If one had only the power to think (something), thinking would scatter among endless series of objects. It would be impossible to think back and reflect [Nachdenken], for positive potency, the preponderance of positivity, only permits anticipation and thinking ahead.
		- [[Quote]]: Paradoxically, hyperactivity represents an extremely passive form of doing, which bars the possibility of free action. It is based on positive potency that has been made absolute to the exclusion of all else.
