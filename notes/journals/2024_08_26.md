- Listening to [[The Anxious Generation]]
	- The book references a lot of relevant and very interesting research, showing clearly that the introduction of high speed internet, social media, and attention seeking features in smart phone apps had clear and often negative influence on child and adolescent development.
	- But there were other factors as well, especially in cultures dominated by the english language, and the introduction of the 24 hour news cycle. The perception of society has changed, and so has what is acceptable and what is not. Children used to be raised, in some sense, by adults in their surroundings as far as 1980s. It is shown on an example of New York, so large metropolitan community, not an rural one. The change then started with the 24 hour news cycle, where parents started fearing much more about their children. Eventually adults started fearing interacting with non-familiar children. A few big cases of clear abuses of trust have pushed it further. Children became much more supervised, when what they need to develop is unsupervised time to explore the boundaries of their confidence.
	- The author suggests that what is needed, and what children across the cultures naturally are drawn to, are activities which are mildly dangerous. Risk on mild, acute (not chronic) harm is necessary for development of people, and many other organisms. (Example of a self sustainable habitat experiment where trees unexposed to wind were breaking under their own weight). The children are "unfrigile", which makes them bounce back easily, and stronger. This is true both physical and psychological stress and recovery.
	- [Facebook papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Facebook_leak), a collection of internal Facebook documents leaked in 2021, shows clearly the intentional manipulation of adolescent brain vlunerabilities by the organisation. There are other interesting examples too.
	- The book has a [companion website](https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/research) with a regularly updated errata, notes and figures (so they can be seen if listening to the book).
	- The key points and the data analysis to []evidence](https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/research/the-evidence) the findings are available too.
