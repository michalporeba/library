- Listening to [[Medic]]
	- Chapter 7
		- Story of Lance Corporal [[Henry Eric Harden]] who first joined [[St John Ambulance]] and then [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], and finally, aged 30 in 1942, the 45 Royal Marine Commando. He wrote many letters to his wife Maud, and so many stories about being a medic in a 1940s commando unit fighting through D-Day, and then further into Holland. Eric Harden was a fighting medic, trained with the commandos, and in the end he was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. [[Quote]]: No medic has been so honoured with the highest medal for valour since  Captain [[John Fox Russell]] in 1917 and none has since.
- Reading [[The Burnout Society]]
	- The Society of Tiredness
		- [[Quote]]: The society of achievement and activness is generating excessive tiredness and exhaustion.
		- With the above the connection is drawn with the first chapter comparing the mental issues with bodies immunological reaction, or rather lack of the reaction as the problem is with abundance of positivity and lack of negativity.
		- The previous concepts of positivity and negativity of *to-do* and *not-to* are used again to show differences of the traditional tiredness (with references to Judaism and the meaning of Sabbath) which is about *not-to*, about not doing, and modern tiredness that makes as *to-do* more.
